A real-time score counting and recording system (v0.1)
	1.Using CloudMqtt server to inforamtion relay
	2.python code(mqttClient.py) for listening and counting
	3.python code(arch_scorer.py) for GUI input score
	4.Can use any-typing interface for uploading score  
		including smartphone/tablet/ ... 
	5. the X/10/M will be counting 
	
Usage mathod:
		1. All the information will send to the mqtt server(CloudMqtt) and be relayed to the counting PC.  
		2. Each archer will using his/her own input device to upload his/her score
		3. Based on the ablility/limitation of server, All the archers/mulitple archerys will using the same ID/PW 
		4. In the MQTT server, each archer will have his/her own "topic", which is the each arrow's score in the singla round 
		5. For example : "tw/arch_score" is my topic now, i have to upload my socre to this topic,
		   and countng PC will listen this topic to identify the belonging of senting-in data 
		6. the input must follow the input format ==> "1.2.3.4.5.6"
			6.1 using "." as spacer ==> if using "," or " " ==>ERROR STOP!!
			6.2 the last arrow couldnot add this "."  ==>ERROR STOP!!
				it should not add "." before the first arrow ,too ==>ERROR STOP!!
				or exsit and ". ." or ".." ==>ERROR STOP!!	
			6.3 six arrows in each round, no more and no less 
				==> if more or less than 6 ==> the entire round will not ne counting!!
			6.4 either "X" or "x","M" or "m" can be used, but "M" should not be noted as "0" ==> the counting of "M" will be less reality
			6.5 the system can input 1~10,X,M only
				using another letter ==> ERROR STOP!!
				using another number ==> Can work!! but system cannot find it's wrong 
				
				
Need to be inproved
	1. Need internet(using public mqtt server) 
		--> can build our mqtt server => using only intranet -->still need wifi/intranet cover
	
*	2. The counting program must be listening all-time <- if it's not open when data sent-in, it will miss
		--> 2.a Change the massage to retaining.	2.b using Qos=2 to make sure solid massage handover
		
	3. Coding another input interface with pure typing
		using mouse to click is too slow and less usefull
			
	4. the checking input mechanism most be build
		To relax the format of input .e.q.: 6.1,6.2 ...
		Remaining user and letting he/she input again when wrong input happened
